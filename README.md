### A web performance showdown

I was given the task at work to optimize our front-end performance. There are plenty of resources out there with suggestions on how to speed things up, and every now and then I would come across suggested targets for certain metrics. Some of the techniques were not plausible for our context, and some of the goals seemed absolutely unattainable. Was our site so unreasonably slow? Were we doing everything wrong?

There is just no way an image-heavy site is going to perform as well as a purely text site, so I found it useful to look at our performance in the context of our market. As fast as possible should still be the aim, and the industry leader still has room for improvement, but this tool can help you set reachable goals, knowing how you and your competitors are limited by the requirements (hella ads?) of your site's intention.

__Note:__ I only spent an afternoon putting this project together, so there is MUCH room for improvement. If there is demand, I can definitely address issues and feature requests. Or feel free to open a pull request... since it's such small scale, I don't have any contribution guidelines at this point.
